# Movie-Recommendation-using-Langchain


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a **Recommendation System** using **LangChain** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The notebook demonstrates how to leverage modern AI tools to build intelligent and context-aware recommendation systems.

## Features

- **Integration with LangChain**: Utilize the powerful LangChain framework to structure and handle LLM-based workflows.
- **Large Language Models**: Leverage the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to analyze, understand, and generate recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Designed for adapting to diverse datasets and use cases.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Clear, step-by-step explanations and code to make it easy to follow along.
